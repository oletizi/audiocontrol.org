The Roland RC-100 is a dedicated control surface designed for Roland's S-series samplers. It connects to the sampler's control port and provides physical buttons and a jog wheel for navigating the graphical interface, offering a button-driven alternative to the [MU-1 mouse](/roland/s330/mu-1-mouse).

## Design and Controls

The RC-100 is a compact tabletop unit with a flat, angled form factor. Its controls are arranged for quick access to sampler functions:

- **Function buttons** — direct access to frequently used sampler modes and menus
- **Cursor navigation** — four-directional pad for moving through on-screen menus
- **Jog wheel** — rotary encoder for scrolling through values and lists
- **Increment/Decrement** — dedicated buttons for stepping parameter values
- **Execute** — confirm selections and operations

The controller connects to the sampler's mouse/controller port via the same 9-pin D-sub connector used by the MU-1 mouse.

## Workflow Comparison

The RC-100 and MU-1 mouse provide different approaches to the same interface:

| Aspect | MU-1 Mouse | RC-100 Controller |
|--------|------------|-------------------|
| Navigation | Point and click | Button and jog wheel |
| Speed | Fast for random-access clicks | Fast for sequential scrolling |
| Envelope editing | Drag points directly | Step through values |
| Menu navigation | Click menu items | Navigate with cursor buttons |
| Precision | Depends on motor control | Consistent stepping |

Neither approach is categorically better — the choice depends on editing habits and the specific task. Mouse control excels at graphical operations like envelope editing and waveform point placement, while the RC-100 is efficient for parameter scrolling and menu-driven workflows.

## Availability

The RC-100 is extremely rare. It was produced in small quantities as an optional accessory and was less widely distributed than the MU-1 mouse. Finding a working unit requires patience and luck:

- **Specialized vintage audio dealers** — occasionally surface in curated inventories
- **Japanese auction sites** — the domestic market had higher distribution
- **Roland collector communities** — private sales between enthusiasts

The RC-100's rarity and limited production make it one of the harder S-series accessories to acquire.

## Compatible Hardware

| Device | Notes |
|--------|-------|
| Roland S-330 | Primary use case |
| Roland S-550 | Same controller port and protocol |
| Roland W-30 | Same controller port and protocol |

## Alternatives

### MU-1 Mouse

The [Roland MU-1](/roland/s330/mu-1-mouse) (or any MSX-compatible mouse) provides graphical point-and-click control. While also rare, MSX mice are more commonly available than the RC-100 due to their wider use across the MSX computer ecosystem.

### The Web Editor

The [audiocontrol.org S-330 web editor](/roland/s330/editor) provides a modern browser-based interface that eliminates the need for either the RC-100 or MU-1. It communicates directly with the S-330 via MIDI System Exclusive and includes virtual front panel controls that replicate the function buttons and navigation available on the RC-100.

For tasks accessible through SysEx — patch editing, tone editing, envelope shaping, and real-time parameter control — the web editor is a full replacement for the original control hardware.
