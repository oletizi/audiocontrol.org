# Roland S-770

The Roland S-770 is Roland's flagship digital sampler, released in 1989 as the successor to the 12-bit [S-550](/roland/s550/) and [S-330](/roland/s330/). It represents a generational leap in Roland's sampling technology, moving from 12-bit to 16-bit resolution with stereo sampling, expanded polyphony, and digital audio connectivity.

## History and Design

The S-770 arrived at the peak of hardware sampling, when professional studios relied on dedicated rack-mount samplers for sample playback and sound design. Roland positioned it as a no-compromise instrument for professional use.

Key advances over the 12-bit S-series:

- **16-bit resolution** at up to 48 kHz sample rate — matching CD quality and supporting professional digital audio standards
- **Stereo sampling** — the S-330 and S-550 are mono samplers
- **24-voice polyphony** — up from 16 voices in the earlier models
- **32-part multitimbral** — four times the S-330/S-550's 8-part capability
- **Massive memory expansion** — up to 16 MB, compared to the S-550's 2 MB maximum
- **Digital I/O** — AES/EBU and S/PDIF connections for digital transfers
- **SCSI** — hard drive support for fast sample loading and large library management

The S-770 retains Roland's signature graphical editing approach, displaying its interface on a dedicated external monitor. The display resolution and color capability are improved over the S-550, though the fundamental mouse-driven workflow is similar.

## Sound Character

The move to 16-bit changes the sonic character significantly. Where the [S-330](/roland/s330/) and [S-550](/roland/s550/) have a distinctive gritty, characterful quality from their 12-bit converters, the S-770 offers cleaner, more transparent reproduction. Neither is inherently better — the 12-bit and 16-bit sounds serve different musical contexts.

The S-770's filters and envelopes continue Roland's time-variant design philosophy, but with increased resolution and parameter range. The overall sound is smoother and more detailed, suitable for the higher-fidelity sample libraries that 16-bit resolution enables.

## Relationship to the S-Series Family

The S-770 is the evolutionary endpoint of Roland's rack sampler line:

- **[Roland S-330](/roland/s330/)** — the entry-level 12-bit sampler (1987)
- **[Roland S-550](/roland/s550/)** — the full-featured 12-bit sampler (1987)
- **[Roland W-30](/roland/w30/)** — the 12-bit sampling workstation (1989)
- **Roland S-770** — the 16-bit flagship (1989)

The S-770 cannot load S-330/S-550 format disks directly — the file formats differ between the 12-bit and 16-bit generations. However, the editing paradigm, interface philosophy, and general architecture descend directly from the earlier S-series design.

Roland later released the S-750 (a more affordable version of the S-770) and the S-760 (a further cost-reduced variant), extending the 16-bit S-series through the early 1990s.
