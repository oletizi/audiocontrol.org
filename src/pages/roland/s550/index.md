# Roland S-550

The Roland S-550 is the full-featured member of Roland's 12-bit S-series sampler family. Released in 1987 alongside its compact sibling the [S-330](/roland/s330/), the S-550 occupies 2U of rack space and expands on the S-330's capabilities with more sample memory, a dedicated RGB monitor output, and additional I/O.

## History and Design

The S-550 represented Roland's professional-tier offering in the S-series lineup. While the [S-330](/roland/s330/) targeted budget-conscious musicians with a stripped-down 1U package, the S-550 provided the full experience: expanded memory, a high-quality RGB video output for a dedicated monitor, and room for memory expansion.

The two samplers share the same core architecture — the same sampling engine, the same filter design, the same 12-bit converters, and the same disk format. Sound libraries created for one can be loaded into the other (within memory constraints). The primary differences are physical:

- **Memory**: The S-550 ships with 512 KB and supports expansion up to 2 MB. The S-330 has a fixed, smaller memory allocation.
- **Video output**: The S-550 includes a dedicated 8-pin DIN RGB output producing a color display at 640x200 resolution. The S-330 only has composite video (monochrome).
- **Form factor**: 2U vs. 1U rack space.
- **Additional I/O**: The S-550 includes more rear-panel connectivity options.

## The S-550 Interface

Like all S-series devices, the S-550 was designed for mouse-driven graphical editing. Its RGB monitor output displays colorful menus, waveform editors, and envelope curves. Navigation uses the same [MU-1 mouse](/roland/s330/mu-1-mouse) or [RC-100 remote controller](/roland/s330/rc-100) as the S-330.

The S-550's color display is a notable advantage over the S-330's monochrome composite output. Parameter groups, selected items, and waveform data are color-coded, making complex editing sessions easier to follow.

## Relationship to Other S-Series Devices

The S-550 sits at the center of the S-series ecosystem:

- **[Roland S-330](/roland/s330/)** — the compact, affordable version of the same engine
- **[Roland S-770](/roland/s770/)** — the next-generation 16-bit flagship that succeeded the S-series 12-bit line
- **[Roland W-30](/roland/w30/)** — a sampling workstation that pairs the S-330/S-550 engine with a keyboard and sequencer

The S-550 and S-330 are functionally interchangeable for most sampling tasks. Users who need more memory or a color display choose the S-550; those prioritizing rack space and budget choose the S-330.
