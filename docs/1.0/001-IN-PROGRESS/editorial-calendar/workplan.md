## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Calendar Structure & Basic Management

**Deliverable:** Can manage a markdown editorial calendar via Claude Code skills

- [x] Define calendar entry types and stage definitions (types.ts)
- [x] Design markdown calendar format (machine-parseable tables per stage)
- [x] Implement calendar markdown parser and writer (calendar.ts)
- [x] Create initial `docs/editorial-calendar.md` with stage sections and existing published content
- [x] Create `/editorial-help` skill: show workflow overview and calendar status
- [x] Create `/editorial-add` skill: add a new entry to Ideas
- [x] Create `/editorial-plan` skill: move entry to Planned, set target keywords
- [x] Create `/editorial-review` skill: display calendar status across all stages
- [x] Create barrel export (index.ts) and verify build

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/editorial-add "Post Title"` adds an entry to the Ideas section
- `/editorial-plan post-slug` moves an entry to Planned
- `/editorial-review` shows a summary of entries in each stage
- `/editorial-help` shows the workflow and lists all editorial skills
- Calendar file is human-readable and machine-parseable
- Existing published posts are pre-populated in the calendar

### Phase 2: Post Scaffolding

**Deliverable:** `/editorial-draft` creates a ready-to-write blog post with all boilerplate

- [x] Create `/editorial-draft` skill: create blog post directory and index.md with frontmatter
- [x] Generate frontmatter from calendar entry metadata (title, description, target keywords)
- [x] Create a GitHub issue for the post with acceptance criteria
- [x] Move calendar entry to Drafting stage with link to issue
- [x] Create `/editorial-publish` skill: update calendar with publish date, close GitHub issue
- [x] Implement scaffold.ts library for post scaffolding
- [x] Follow existing blog post conventions from workflow-playbooks.md

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/editorial-draft post-slug` creates `src/pages/blog/<slug>/index.md` with correct frontmatter
- A GitHub issue is created and linked in the calendar entry
- `/editorial-publish post-slug` marks the entry as Published with the current date
- Generated file structure matches existing blog post conventions

### Phase 3: Analytics Integration

**Deliverable:** Virtuous feedback loop — analytics drives topic suggestions and flags posts needing updates

- [ ] Create `/editorial-suggest` skill: invoke analytics report, parse search opportunities and content gaps
- [ ] Present suggestions to user with source data (impressions, position, CTR gap)
- [ ] Allow user to accept suggestions into the Ideas stage (via `/editorial-add`)
- [ ] Create `/editorial-performance` skill: pull analytics for published posts
- [ ] Flag underperforming posts (declining traffic, high impressions but low CTR)
- [ ] Surface "update recommended" entries with specific improvement suggestions
- [ ] Implement suggest.ts library for analytics integration
- [ ] Track analytics-suggested vs manually added entries in the calendar

**Acceptance Criteria:**
- `/editorial-suggest` shows content opportunities derived from analytics data
- `/editorial-performance` shows metrics for published posts and flags underperformers
- Suggestions include specific data (e.g., "query X has 200 impressions at position 8 — no page targets it")
- Underperformers include specific improvement recommendations

## Verification Checklist

- [ ] `npm run build` succeeds (no build breakage)
- [ ] Calendar file is parseable by the script and readable by humans
- [ ] All skill commands work end-to-end
- [ ] Post scaffolding matches existing blog conventions
- [ ] Analytics integration produces actionable suggestions
- [ ] No secrets committed to the repository
