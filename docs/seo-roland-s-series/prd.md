# PRD: SEO Content — Roland S-Series Samplers

## Problem Statement

audiocontrol.org hosts a free web editor for the Roland S-330 sampler, but the site has limited discoverability for users searching for information about the S-330 and related Roland S-series hardware. There are no dedicated pages covering the hardware itself, its accessories, or the broader S-series ecosystem.

Musicians searching for information about the Roland S-330, MU-1 mouse, RC-100 controller, S-550, S-770, or W-30 currently find fragmented information across forums and wikis, with no single resource that ties the ecosystem together and connects to the web editor.

## User Stories

1. **As a musician who just acquired an S-330**, I want to find comprehensive information about the sampler's specs and accessories so I can understand what hardware I need for editing.

2. **As a potential S-series buyer**, I want to compare the S-330, S-550, S-770, and W-30 so I can choose the right sampler for my needs.

3. **As an S-330 owner looking for control hardware**, I want to understand my options for the MU-1 mouse and RC-100 controller, including alternatives and the web editor, so I can start editing patches.

4. **As a music production enthusiast**, I want to learn about the history and sonic character of the S-series family so I can understand their role in music production history.
