/**
 * remark plugin: strip the first H1 from rendered markdown output.
 *
 * The editorialcontrol voice pattern is "repeat the title above the
 * body" (a print-magazine convention that reorients the reader after
 * a page turn). On a scrolling web document the convention reads as
 * repetition — the BlogLayout header already renders the title from
 * frontmatter, so the markdown body's leading `# Title` appears as a
 * second copy right under the feature image. This plugin drops that
 * first H1 from the rendered tree while leaving the markdown file
 * intact (so the `.md` still validates as a standalone document and
 * the operator keeps writing `# Title` at the top of the body per
 * voice guidance).
 *
 * Stripping shape: find the first top-level H1 in the document and
 * remove it. All other H1s (rare in these posts, but possible) are
 * preserved. No-op when the document has no leading H1.
 *
 * Same registration pattern as `remark-strip-outline.mjs` — loaded
 * into both site configs' `remarkPlugins` AND the editorial-review
 * unified render pipeline so production and review match.
